# Language subset 4

## Summary

* Only values allowed are of basic type nil, boolean, int, string, list and mapping.
* The only type descriptors allowed are `boolean`, `int`, `string`, `any`, `any[]` and `map<any>`.
* At module level, only function definitions:
   * no default arguments
   * no rest arguments
   * may be declared public
* Statements:
   * function/method call statement
   * local variable declaration with explicit type and expression
   * assignment
      * to variable `v = E;`
      * to member of a list `v[E1] = E2;`
   * `return` statement
   * `if`/`else` statements
   * `while` statement
   * `break` and `continue` statements
   * `foreach` statements that use  `<..`
* Expressions:
   * binary operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `&`, `^`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`
   * unary operators: `-`, `!`
   * type cast
   * function call
   * method call `v.f(args)` syntax for calling langlib functions
   * member access `E[i]`
   * list constructor `[E1, E2, ..., En]`
   * mapping constructor `{ f1: E1, f2: E2,..., fn: En }`
   * literals for nil, boolean, int and string
* Langlib functions:
  * `array:length`
  * `array:push`
  * `string:length`
* The only imported function that can be called is `io:println` and it can only be called with a single argument.

## Grammar

This deals explicitly with operator precedence and associativity.

Language spec syntax references:
* [string-literal](https://ballerina.io/spec/lang/2021R1/#string-literal)

## Semantic restrictions

The implementation of `string` has the following additional restrictions:

 * `+` operator is not supported with operands of type `string`
 * member access `s[i]` is not supported when `s` has type `string`

Method call syntax can be used for calling the following langlib functions:

* `array:length`
* `array:push`
* `string:length`

The following restrictions apply to imported modules:

* only `ballerina/io` can be imported
* the only function from `ballerina/io` that can be called is `println`
* `println` only accepts a single argument (which is of type `any`)

## Notes

* The syntax restricts where a `list-constructor-expr` can occur so as to avoid the need to infer a type for the constructed list.

## Additions from subset 3

Add `string` and `map<any>`:

* New type descriptors
  * `string`
  * `map<any>`
* New expressions
  * string literals `"abc"`
  * mapping constructor `{"x": 1, "y": 2}`
  * shift expressions `255 >> 2`
  * hex int literals `0Xba1decaf`
* `final` qualifier for local variable declarations

Existing syntax extended:

* `===`, `!==` for string and map
* `==`, `!=` for string
* `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` for string
* `<T>E` for `string` and `map<any>`
* `io:println`

Langlib:
* `string:length`
* `map:length`

## Implemented spec changes since 2021R1

* [#814](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-spec/issues/814) - improved typing rules for `==` and `!=`
* [#887]((https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-spec/issues/887) - improved treatment of unreachability
