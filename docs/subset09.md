# Language subset 9

## Summary

* Only values allowed are of basic type nil, boolean, int, float, string, list, mapping and error.
* At module level
   * function definitions
      * no default arguments
      * no rest arguments
      * may be declared public
   * const definitions
      * not of structured types
   * type definitions
* Type descriptors:
   * predefined basic type name: `boolean`, `float`, `int`, `string`, `error`
   * `any` type
   * optional type: `T?` where T is one of the above types
   * union of the above types e.g. `int|string?`
   * `map<M>` where M any of the above types
   * `M[]` where `M` is either a type name `T` or `T?`, or a parenthesized union e.g. `(any|error)[]`
   * closed record type descriptor
   * a reference to a type defined by a type definition
* Statements:
   * function/method call statement
   * local variable declaration with explicit type descriptor and initializer
      * parentheses are not supported in the type descriptor; a type reference must be used instead
   * assignment
      * to variable `v = E;`
      * to member of a list or mapping `v[E1] = E2;`
      * compound assignment `op=`
   * `return` statement
   * `if`/`else` statements
   * `while` statement
   * `break` and `continue` statements
   * `foreach` statements that use  `<..`
   * `match` statement with match patterns that are const
   * `panic` statement
* Expressions:
   * literals for nil, boolean, int, float and string
   * binary operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `&`, `^`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`
   * unary operators: `-`, `!`, `~`
   * type cast `<T>E`
   * type test `E is T`, `E !is T`
   * function call
   * method call `v.f(args)` syntax for calling langlib functions
   * member access `E[i]` for both list and mapping
   * list constructor `[E1, E2, ..., En]`
   * mapping constructor `{ f1: E1, f2: E2,..., fn: En }`
   * error constructor `error(msg)`
   * `check` expression
   * `checkpanic` expression
* Langlib functions:
  * `array:length`
  * `array:push`
  * `string:length`
  * `map:length`
  * `int:toHexString`
  * `error:message`
* Standard library functions:
  * `io:println` (restricted to a single argument)

## Grammar

This deals explicitly with operator precedence and associativity.

## Semantic restrictions

There are the following additional restrictions:

 * member access `s[i]` is not supported when `s` has type `string`
 * relational operators are not supported when the static type of either of the operands includes nil

Method call syntax can be used for calling the following langlib functions:

* `array:length`
* `array:push`
* `string:length`
* `map:length`
* `int:toHexString`
* `error:message`

Two kinds of `import` are supported.

1. An import with an organization of `ballerina` is allowed with the following restrictions
   * only `ballerina/io` can be imported
   * the only function from `ballerina/io` that can be called is `println`
   * `println` only accepts a single argument (which is of type `any`)
2. An import with no organization and with a module name starting with `root`. An `import root.X;` in a file `F.bal` will read the module from the files `F.modules/X/*.bal`.

## Notes

* The syntax restricts where a `list-constructor-expr` or `mapping-constructor-expr` can occur so as to avoid the need to infer a type for the constructed list.
* Types in type definitions are restricted semantically, rather than syntactically: a type definition that is referenced from a function definition must define a type that is equivalent to one that can be described using the type-defn grammar in this document. It must also match the type-defn [grammar supported for semantic type-checking](type-subset.md).
