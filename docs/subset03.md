# Language subset 3

## Summary

* Only values allowed are of basic type nil, boolean, int and list.
* The only type descriptors allowed are `boolean`, `int`, `any` and `any[]`.
* At module level, only function definitions:
   * no default arguments
   * no rest arguments
   * may be declared public
* Statements:
   * function/method call statement
   * local variable declaration with explicit type and expression
   * assignment
      * to variable `v = E;`
      * to member of a list `v[E1] = E2;`
   * `return` statement
   * `if`/`else` statements
   * `while` statement
   * `break` and `continue` statements
   * `foreach` statements that use  `<..`
* Expressions:
   * binary operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `&`, `^`, `|`
   * unary operators: `-`, `!`
   * type cast
   * function call
   * method call `v.f(args)` syntax for calling langlib functions
   * member access `E[i]`
   * list constructor `[E1, E2, ..., En]`
   * literals for nil, boolean and int
* Langlib functions:
  * `array:length`
  * `array:push`
* The only imported function that can be called is `io:println` and it can only be called with a single argument.

## Grammar

This deals explicitly with operator precedence and associativity.

## Semantic restrictions

Method call syntax can be used for calling the following langlib functions:

* `array:length`
* `array:push`

The following restrictions apply to imported modules:

* only `ballerina/io` can be imported
* the only function from `ballerina/io` that can be called is `println`
* `println` only accepts a single argument (which is of type `any`)

## Notes

* The syntax restricts where a `list-constructor-expr` can occur so as to avoid the need to infer a type for the constructed list.

## Additions from subset 2

Type `any[]` and some related operations:

* New type descriptors: `any[]`
* New expressions
   * list constructors `[1, 2, 3]`
   * `E[n]`
   * method call
 * Allow member access lvalues in assignment `V[k] = E;`
 * Allow call statements to be method calls
 * Langlib (called using method call syntax)
    * array:length

Existing syntax extended:
* `===`, `!==`
* `io:println`

Langlib:
* `array:length`
* `array:push`

## Implemented spec changes since 2021R1

* [#814](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-spec/issues/814) - improved typing rules for `==` and `!=`
* [#887]((https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-spec/issues/887) - improved treatment of unreachability
